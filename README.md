# Text duplicate detection
 This repo focuses on the evaluation of various techniques for identifying duplicates. It aims to explore and compare different methods to determine which approach is most effective in identifying and handling duplicates within a dataset.
 
## Getting Started

 I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage packages - so install poetry first if you haven't already.

To install dependencies, do:

```
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
```
 
## Notebooks
This section covers the notebook that used to run to produce the various outputs  from the presented data.
