    "### Modify Report to Include Duplicated Rows in the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this modification is to include the duplicated rows in the DataFrame, along with an additional column indicating whether each row is duplicated or not. By doing so, we can have a clear view of the duplicated data and facilitate further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the following steps were taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The full dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset was split into two samples: one containing duplicate rows and the other containing non-duplicate rows. This division ensured that both types of data were included for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate Sample with ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The duplicate sample was subjected to the chatGPT process, which involved restructuring the text to generate variations while preserving the essence of the original information. This step was crucial in simulating different text structures for the duplicated rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeling Duplicate Rows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to differentiate between duplicate and non-duplicate rows, a new column was added to the DataFrame. This additional column indicates whether each row is a duplicate or not. By labeling the rows accordingly, we can easily identify and analyze the duplicated data within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating these modifications, the DataFrame now includes the duplicated rows, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the data. The new column serves as a valuable indicator for distinguishing between duplicate and non-duplicate entries, enabling efficient analysis and further processing of the dataset."
